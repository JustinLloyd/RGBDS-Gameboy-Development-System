	<TD ALIGN="Center">1 Dec. 96</TD>
	<TD>Fixed  bug  in <A HREF="incbin.htm">INCBIN</A> (sometimes reported the section full)<BR>
                 Added <A HREF="miscfunc.htm">DEF()</A> function</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD ALIGN="Center">1.02</TD>
	<TD ALIGN="Center">12 Feb. 97</TD>
	<TD>Added <A HREF="expr_str.htm">STRLEN(), STRCAT(), STRIN(), STRCMP(), STRSUB(), STRUPR() and STRLWR()</A> functions<BR>
	<A HREF="export.htm">IMPORT/EXPORT/GLOBAL</A> takes multiple arguments now<BR>
	<A HREF="section.htm">HRAM</A> sectiontype added<BR>
	ORG like features added to <A HREF="section.htm">SECTION</A><BR>
	<A HREF="trg_gb.htm">LDIO</A> mnemonic added</TD>

<TR>
	<TD ALIGN="Center">1.03</TD>
	<TD ALIGN="Center">23 Mar. 97</TD>
	<TD>The <A HREF="section.htm">HRAM section</A> was 128 bytes long instead of 127. potentially thrashing the interrupt enable register if you filled the HRAM.<BR>
	The <A HREF="miscfunc.htm">BANK() function</A>, when used on a symbol defined in the current sourcefile, returned the wrong bank ID. (reported by Harry P. Mulder)<BR>
	The <A HREF="miscfunc.htm">BANK() function</A> didn't check whether the argument was a properly defined symbol. (reported by Harry P. Mulder)<BR>
	Completely new lexical analyser module. This fixed several linenumber bugs and other macro/if/rept related bugs. Also fixed a bug which made it possible to have equated symbols with the same name as a reserved keyword (if you get a "parse error" with this release on some of your sources, this is probably what is going on)<BR>
	<A HREF="fail.htm">FAIL and WARN</A> commands.<BR>
	<A HREF="presym.htm">__LINE__, __FILE__, __TIME__, __DATE__</A> predefined symbols added.<BR>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD ALIGN="Center">1.04</TD>
	<TD ALIGN="Center">03 July 1997</TD>
	<TD>First ASMotor release<BR>
<A HREF="presym.htm">__TIME__ and __DATE__</A> give todays date instead of when the assembler was compiled.<BR>
Sometimes the first line of a file wouldn't assemble correctly. Reported by Jeff Frohwein.<BR>
Unrolling multiline <A HREF="equs.htm">string symbols</A> left the linecounter in a sorry state. Jeff Frohwein again.<BR>
<A HREF="db.htm">DB and DW</A> can now (officially ;-) be used in BSS/HRAM/VRAM sections without any arguments to reserve a byte or a word respectively. Reported/suggested/inspired by Mr. Frohwein.<BR>
The character # can now be used as part of a <A HREF="symbols.htm">symbol name</A>. Jeff....<BR>
The <A HREF="rs.htm">RS</A> counter "_RS" is now defined from the very start of the assembly process instead of after the first RSSET or RSRESET.<BR>
Bug fixed: You couldn't use \0-\9 and \@ in <A HREF="expr_str.htm">{} constructs</A><BR>
<A HREF="purge.htm">PURGE</A> pseudo-op added. Purges a symbol from the symboltable and memory. Use with extreme caution! Inspired by Harry P. Mulder<BR>
<A HREF="macro.htm">MACRO</A> parameter passing method changed drastically. Read (and re-read) the manual for details. Suggested by Harry P. Mulder.<BR>
</TD>
<TR>
	<TD ALIGN="Center">1.05</TD>
	<TD ALIGN="Center">20 July 1997</TD>
	<TD><B>RGBDS fixes:</B><BR>
	RGBAsm supports the LDD and LDI syntax plus [HLD] and [HLI]. LDH is
	synonymous with LDIO.<BR>
	<B>General fixes:</B><BR>
There was a bug in the macro parameter passing. Any whitespace after the
last parameter would be appended to the last parameter. Reported by Jeff Frohwein.<BR>
A section stack has been implemented. Look up <A HREF="pops.htm">POPS and PUSHS</A>. Jeff Frohweins doing again.<BR>
<A HREF="opt.htm">OPT</A> command added for defining and changing some options while assembling.<BR>
You can now define which characters are used for the <A HREF="expr_int.htm">Gameboy graphics
integer (`)</A> using the <A HREF="usage.htm">commandline</A> or the new <A HREF="opt.htm">OPT</A> command. Cool idea by (surprise surprise) Jeff Frohwein.<BR>
Also, an option stack has been added. Look up <A HREF="popo.htm">POPO and PUSHO</A> in the
manual.<BR>
Fixed yet another line number bug reported by Jeff Frohwein (when will this guy leave me alone? ;)<BR>
</TD>
<TR>

	<TD ALIGN="Center">22 July 1997</TD>
	<TD><B>General fixes:</B><BR>
The lamest typo bug of all time has been fixed. RGBAsm would output a word defined with DW as 4 bytes instead of 2. Jeff Frohwein reported this.<BR>
The first line of an included file didn't assemble correctly.<BR>
<A HREF="usage.htm">-b option</A> added for setting the characters used for binary constants.<BR>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD ALIGN="Center">1.08</TD>
	<TD ALIGN="Center">21 September 1997</TD>
	<TD><B>General fixes:</B><BR>
A crash occured if you tried to use a macro symbol in an expression.
(Jeff Frohwein)<BR>
You couldn't use STRCMP, STRLEN and STRIN in relocatable expressions. (Harry
P. Mulder)<BR>
Relocatable symbols are no longer allowed as arguments to the DEF function.<BR>
Bug fixed in the assembler where it would sometimes write out too many bytes
for HRAM section definitions.<BR>
