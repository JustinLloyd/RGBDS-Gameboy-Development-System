<P>The PURGE command allows you to completely remove a symbol from the symbol table as if it had never existed. USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION!!! I can't stress this enough but you <B>seriously</B> need to know what you are doing. DON'T purge symbol that you use in expressions the linker needs to calculate. In fact, it's probably not even safe to purge anything other than string symbols and macros.<BR>

<P>Note that string symbols that are part of a PURGE command WILL NOT BE EXPANDED as the ONLY exception to this rule.<BR>
