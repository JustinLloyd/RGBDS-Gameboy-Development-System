Fix List (things to do)
========================

BUG[BURT]: Fix the LDI instruction so that it handles the brackets around HL
BUG[BURT]: Fix the Linker
	GLOBAL sym
	DW	sym

	will crash the linker because "sym" was declared global and referenced but never actually defined. Probably a memory reference
	error (refers to memory 0xFFFFFFFF).
BUG[YARIN]: _NARG works on pass 1, but on pass 2 I get error?! (symbol doesn't exist)
BUG[YARIN]: commenting lines with *** doesn't seem to work?!
BUG[YARIN]: you have to type jp @-1 to jump to the same address, but jr @ is fine... seems @ works a bit weird

SUGGESTION: "parse error on line xx" doesn't tell much

SUGGESTION: it looks nicer typing "MACRO macroname" instead of "macroname: MACRO" (invalid suggestion, reason, will break too
much code and does not follow "de facto standard" ways of declaring macros in other assemblers, e.g. DevPac)

SUGGESTION: instead of adding \@ at the end of labels in macro, I suggest something like a ".." prefix (invalid suggestion, reason:
will break too much code and does not follow "de facto standard" ways of declaring unique macro labels in other assemblers (verify this))

FEATURE: Fix the assembler so that it handles regular brackets in Z80 instructions, as well as square brackets.
FEATURE: adding possibility to specify which RAM bank a BSS variable should be in (a must)
FEATURE: more control where sections should be. starting sections at a masked address (ALIGN)
FEATURE: add BANK[Bank(label_name)] directive

BUG[YARIN]: The following code breaks:
		DUMMY  EQUS "[$C000]"
		ld a,DUMMY
but the following code works:
		YUMMY  EQUS "[$C000]"
		ld a,YUMMY
probably due to the fact that DUMMY starts with the first letter of a register name. Using the EQU directive appears to work.

FEATURE: Local symbol output for all symbols
FEATURE: BSS banking (for multiple RAM banks on CGB)
FEATURE: Add option to use Intel/Zilog format binary & hex numbers (1234h instead of $1234 and 10101010b instead of %10101010)
FEATURE: Add -q (quiet) option to all tools, only report errors
FEATURE: Output section names in .MAP file
FEATURE: List of unreferenced symbols
FEATURE: Sort sections so that they are in address then symbol order
FEATURE: Output total slack statistics at end of .MAP file
FEATURE: Optional warning on use of JP when JR would have sufficed.

BUG:
The following don't produce compile time errors.

DB
DW
DB 1,
DW 1,

The first two lines should produce an error unless
they are in a BSS or HRAM section. The second two
lines should always produce an error.

BUG:
Following works:
RETP 5
FRAME SET FRAME + 1
DB FRAME
ENDR

BUT this does not work:
RETP 5
FRAME SET FRAME - 1
DB FRAME
ENDR

I have to do following:
RETP 5
FRAME SET FRAME + -1
DB FRAME
ENDR

BUG:
Bug in XLink:
Lines in the link file starting with # should be ignored, but if the line 
is inside a section such as [objects], then it is only the first word that 
is ignored, not the whole line, so
#Hi Otaku
Would give an error, while:
#Hi_Otaku
is okay...
